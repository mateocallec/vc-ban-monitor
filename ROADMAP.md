# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned features, improvements, and future goals for **VC Ban Monitor**.

---

## Current Limitations

- The extension cannot detect if a user has **disabled voice chat in Roblox settings**.
- When the extension's tab is in the background and not in use, the **timer pauses** and becomes **desynchronized** when returning to the tab.

---

## Short-Term Goals (Next Release)

- Detect if a user has **voice chat disabled** in Roblox settings.
